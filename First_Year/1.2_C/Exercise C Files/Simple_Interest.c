Problem Statement
Simple interest is a quick method of calculating the interest charge on a loan. In this article, we will learn to calculate the simple interest in C programming language.

Simple interest is determined by multiplying the daily interest rate by the principal by the number of days that elapse between payments. Divide the product of these three values to convert the percentage value of the interest rate into decimals.

Simple Interest Formula
Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100
Where P is the principal amount, T is the time, and, R is the interest rate.

Input:
p=2000
t=12
R=10

Output:
Simple Interest = 2400
