/*
Problem Statement:
Array_Ascending_order
Different kinds of reasoning can be used to sort things. For the sake of simplicity, 
we shall employ a tried-and-true technique. We choose a certain element from an array, 
compare it to other elements, and then place it appropriately to sort the array.

Input:
Arr[50, 20, 100, 25, 36]

Output:
20 25 36 50 100

Input:
Arr[5, 8, 2, 1, 6]
