/*
Problem Statement
The algorithms prioritize the processes that must be carried out and schedule them accordingly. 
A higher-priority process will receive CPU priority first, and this will continue until all of 
the processes are finished. Due to the processâ€™ greater priority, the Priority Scheduling 
Algorithm is in charge of transferring it from the ready queue to the work queue.

Input:
{{1, 10, 2}, {2, 5, 0}, {3, 8, 1}}

Output:
Order in which processes get executed 
1 3 2

Processes Burst time Waiting time Turn around time
1 10 0 10
3 8 10 18
2 5 18 23

Average waiting time = 9.33333
Average turn around time = 17
