Problem Statement
Radix Sort
Each digit is sorted in the Radix sort algorithm from least to greatest significance. 
In base 10, radix sort would first sort by the digits in the place of one, 
then by the digits in the place of ten, and so on. 
Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to order the data in each digit position.

Input:
312  42  635  11  8  783  954  777

Input:
50 40 30 10 96 100
