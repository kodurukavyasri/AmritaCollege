Problem Statement
SJF_Scheduling
One of the CPU scheduling strategies is to select the shortest jobs first. 
It is an algorithm whose burst time-dependent procedure.
In other words, a process with a lower burst time executes first. 
The shortest job next (SJN) is another name for the shortest job first (SJF). For instance, 
we have four processes, P1, P2, P3, and P4, with burst times of 5, 7, 6, and 2. 
Process P4 will now be run first since it has a shorter burst period. Processes P1, P3, and P2 will then be carried out in that order.

Output:
enter the no of processes: 2
the arrival time for process P1: 10
the burst time for process P1: 5
the arrival time for process P2: 6
the burst time for process P2 : 3
P[10]   |   -22765  |   -32764

average waiting time = -16382.000000
average turnaround time = -11382.500000
