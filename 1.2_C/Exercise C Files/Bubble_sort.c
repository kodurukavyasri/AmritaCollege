Problem Statement
Bubble sort on Linked List
The bubble sortâ€™s fundamental principle is to compare each member of an array individually until they are sorted in ascending order, 
a process known as bubble busting. Instead of shifting the entire array when an element has to be moved, the impacted element is just moved.

Input:
Linked list before sorting
8 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5

Output:
Linked list after sorting
1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 8
