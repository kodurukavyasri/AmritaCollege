Problem Statement
Binary_Search_program
In the C programming language, a sorted array may be searched using a technique called binary search by continually halving the search interval. In order to reduce the time complexity to O, binary search makes use of the fact that the array is sorted (LogN).
This approach always searches the center of an array for the element.
There are two ways to create a binary search program in C:

Iterative Method
Recursive Method

Input:
[11, 14, 25, 30, 40, 45]
40

Output:
Element is present at position 4
