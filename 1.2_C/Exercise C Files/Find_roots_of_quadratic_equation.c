Find_roots_of_quadratic_equation
A quadratic has the formula y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are all integers and a must be 0. 
An illustration of a quadratic equation is 3×2 + 3x + 1.
Let’s talk about what a quadratic equation’s roots are and how to get them from the equation.
The discriminant of a quadratic equation is the expression b2 – 4ac. It describes the roots’ character.

Input:
a = 2.4 b = 4 c = 506

Output:
root1 = -0.87+1.30i and root2 = -0.87-1.30i
