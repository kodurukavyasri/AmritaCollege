            Prior to my undergraduate journey, I attended FIITJEE from 2021 to 2023, where I focused on Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. This rigorous coaching program strengthened my foundation in these subjects, preparing me for the challenges of engineering. Before FIITJEE, I completed my high school education at Kennedy High The Global School from 2016 to 2021, encompassing grades 9 to 12.
