/*
Problem Statement
When two numbers are changed, two variablesâ€™ values are also changed. Think about the variables var1 and var2 you have. 
Var1 is valued at 20, whereas Var2 is valued at 40. As a result, 
after swapping, var1 and var2 will have values of 40 and 20, respectively.

We have discussed different methods such as:
Swapping Two Numbers Using a Third Variable
Swapping Two Numbers Using Without Using Third Variable
Swapping Function in C
Swap two numbers using pointers in C
Swap Two Numbers Using Bitwise XOR

Input:
a = 20 b = 40

Output:
a = 40 b = 20
